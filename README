jDBMD: provides a simple java library for fetching database metadata information, and reading and writing it as XML.

As a Java Library: 
==================
  The dbmd.jar archive may be used as a simple Java library for fetching metadata information for a database schema.  Use class gov.fda.nctr.dbmd.DatabaseMetadataFetcher to fetch metadata information about tables, views, fields and foreign keys in a given schema.  Class DBMD represents the metadata itself and supports reading and writing to and from xml.

As a Standalone Program
=======================
The DatabaseMetadataFetcher class includes a main method which can write database metadata as xml to an output file. To do this, first create a properties file describing the database connnection information, with properties:
jdbc-connect-url, jdbc-driver-class, user, and password.

For example,
#file connection.props
jdbc-connect-url=jdbc:oracle:thin:myhost.mydomain.org:1528:mysid
jdbc-driver-class=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
user=mydbuser
password=mypassword


Then invoke the command like this:

  java -cp dbmd.jar:ojdbc6.jar gov.fda.nctr.dbmd.DatabaseMetadataFetcher myschema connection.props myschema.xml

which would write the database metadata for schema myschema to file myschema.xml.
